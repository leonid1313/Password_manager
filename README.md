Create "Password manager" app to manage all your passwords for different accounts (mails, devices, accounts, servers, etc.)

App should have at least 3 pages: 
    - login
    - register
    - dashboard (main logged in view).

User should be able to 
    - add
    - edit
    - delete
    - reveal 
  passwords on the dashboard after login.

All password data should be stored somewhere, so when user reloads pages, he'll be redirected back to the dashboard and all the passwords will be fetched.

You can choose any DB or local storage.

By default passwords should be hidden with "*", when user clicks the password field it reveals the real password.
